###### Description

Cave of Quizzes is an app allowing the owner (such as a teacher) to easily create multiple choice quizzes which can then be taken by authorized users (such as students).

### Owner / Administator:

When creating a quiz you will be asked to provide:

 - a minimum pass mark (out of 100)

 - a number of points to be awarded if the pass mark is reached or exceeded
 
 - a list of badges to be awarded

 - as many questions as desired.

 - a correct answer and three wrong answers per question


### Other users:

 A user must sign up and then be approved by the administator, in order to take quizzes.

 A user can select a quiz on the front page of the app to take the quiz.

 The user's quiz results and points or badges earned are saved.

 A user can see their quiz history.

 A leaderboard of high scores can be viewed by any user.
